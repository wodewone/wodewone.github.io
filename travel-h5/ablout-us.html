        <h4 class="p-title">Our Team</h4>
        <p>We are a group of idealists with the common-ground of living the Asian-American dream. Study hard, get good grades, get a practical degree, become a professional and climb the corporate ladder. Every single one of us grew up in China, rural or urban, before getting our education and starting professional careers in other parts of the world.</p>
        <p>We are proud of our heritage and proud of whom we are.Yet living outside of China it seems the focus is usually politics, economicsand the environment. Rarely does anyone mention the countless natural wonders, diverse cultures, historic monuments, and mega-metropolises. China is the 3rd largest country in the world, with the east bordering the Pacific Ocean, the west bordering the Himalayans, the north bordering the tundra, and the south bordering the tropics. Oh, it also has the largest population in the world at around 1.6 billion. Yet, why do most people in the world only associate China with a handful of attractions?</p>
        <p>We are travellers and visitors ourselves to other parts of the world, in other words, we are you! We are not looking to bring you to China, we are looking to bring China to you.  So enjoy your stay with us, make some friends, and get to know China!</p>

            <p>More than a logical dreamer,she’s got a talent for diving head first into the unknown. She considers travelling not only a necessity to understand the world we live in,but a key to better understand ourselves. She counts on her list of memories a 3-month trip across the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau, getting high-fives from Gentoo penguins in the Antarctic, and diving in 16 Celsius waters to wait for the giant Molas. This time, she’s taking another dive into the unknown as the driving force behind More Than Panda. </p>
            <p>Her favourite place in China is Tibet for how people live harmoniously with nature.</p>
